My name is Pedro Pinto, real name, but you can find me in the net also as **DENCZH**.

In summary, I am passionate about robust implementations, where maintainability, scalability, and testability are at the core, properly documented, with clear architectures that adhere to standards correctly. I have led digital transformations that have resulted in new opportunities for the companies, reduced errors, and improved performance.

I professionally use DENCZH, a sole proprietorship located in London. Why London? Because of the facilities that the United Kingdom provides for foreigners to establish companies. This country has understood the importance of treating businesses well, with simple rules, minimal costs, and bureaucratic hurdles, perfect for digital nomads like myself.
