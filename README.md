My name is Pedro Pinto, but you can find me in the net also as **denczh**. I am passionate about robust implementations, where maintainability, scalability, and testability are at the core, properly documented, with clear architectures that adhere to standards correctly. I have led digital transformations that have resulted in new opportunities for the companies, reduced errors, and improved performance.

I am currently developing a blockchain focused on advanced NFTs based on the Polkadot SDK, check it at [telurean-chain](https://github.com/telurean/telurean-chain) repository.
